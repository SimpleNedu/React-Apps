    the fucken bucket, but some people take this story all too seriously and in the process
    make other peoples story miserable. Both for those other people and for people around them. 
    ask any of them, they always have a profound excuse and someone to lame for their miscreapancies.
    I dare to ask, if you make anoher miserable because someone is caysimg your misery, and the person and evry other 
    successive person o the list does the same. Dont you think live will be all about revenge and
    misery and the fun will miss out. just an honest opinion thou. " />

    content="God and faith is the focal point of our being, and resultantly, they always always
     do a great job of briging us together. But religion does a far greater work than this two do
    , but its quite interesting how religion which is supposed to strengthen our faith on the issue of God becomes 
    a source of disintegration, anger and disammarment when it comes to beleive in God, In short 
    religion daws us apart as humans." />
